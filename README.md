For the development of your feature, follow the following steps:
- Run ``` git pull ``` to ensure that you have the most up to date repo
- Run ```git branch``` to ensure that you are on the correct branch. If not, run ```git checkout <branch name>``` so that you are on the correct branch
- Implement your feature as a function (look for notes in the metrics document) in the appropriate directory
- Once you are done with your feature, you want to run ```git add <files you want to save>``` followed by ```git commit -m <message>``` to commit your changes. Then to update the remote, you want to ```git push```
